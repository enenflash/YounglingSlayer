Structural changes:

> Change in shape
  - Removed the circular shape of the layers to become an octogon
  - Makes positioning of pieces easier

> Removing Layer 1 (bottom_view.png)
  - L1 was removed to lose weight as ultrasonics can be attached from L3

> Combining L2 with motor mounts (L2-motors.png)
  - Motor mounts were removed to lose weight
  - L2 connects to motors directly
  - Support pillars connecting L2 to L3 are printed separately so that a change in height does not requite redesigns of L2

> IR Mount (IR_mount.png, structure.png)
  - L2 connects to the IR mount using support pillars
  - The IR Mount supports the IR from the bottom (not screwed in)
  - It also separates the individual sensors to reduce interference and incorrect readings
  - The IR Mount connects to L3 through the horizontal and vertical square holes

> Goal stopper used as a handle
  - The goal stopper was redesigned to be easily printable and able to be used as a handle

> Double decker breadboard
  - We intended to use PCBs during states but due to delays we had to use breadboards again
  - Half breadboards are stacked over each other to reduce space

> Cage and ultrasonics
  - Instead of mounting ultrasonics from L1 they are mounted directly to the cage
  - The cage hangs from L3 via a single screw
  - Ultrasonics are horizontal to allow them to be lower and make connecting pins easier

> Battery mount
  - Battery is mounted by encasing it instead of zip ties
