There are 3 new PCBs: (pcbs/)
> Top Board
  - Contains IMU, bluetooth module, switches and battery connector
> Bottom Board
  - Contains Teensy 4.1 and main circuits: motor, ultrasonic and line sensor wires
> Line sensor

Reused parts:
> Ultrasonic mounts and cage pieces
> Goal stopper
> Wheels

L2 and Motors (L2-motors-LS.png)
> The same concept is used where the motors directly attach to L2
> The Line sensor is mounted below the motors and connects to L2

Support pillars
> Metal M3 standoffs are used to connect L2 to the IR mount
  - The metal standoffs are stronger and thinner
  - The bottom board is held between L2 and the metal standoffs
> There are 2 supports above each motor instead of 1

IR mount
> The IR mount is similar to the old one but the ring connecting the dividers is further out

Wheel guards (wheel_guard.png)
> Wheel guards are used to hold the wheels in place
  - Reduces the occurence of wheels falling out
  - Protects wheels from other robots

Wiring (core.png)
> JST-XH headers and housings are used to securely attach component wiring
> Wires are crimped by hand to the exact length needed

Hexagons (hexagons.png)
> Hexagon patterns were added throughout the robot to reduce the weight of printed parts
