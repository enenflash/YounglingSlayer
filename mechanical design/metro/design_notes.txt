General design notes:
> The motors are not in a perfect 'x' shape but are still at 45 degrees.
  - The motors are pushed to the side to give more space for the ball catcher at the front
> We are using breadboards to test out the circuitry and plan to use PCBs later on.
> The wheel size of 7cm was chosen - majority of the design is based on the wheel size (planning.png)
- Last year in standard, our lego wheel size was also ~7cm.

Wheel (wheel/fusion.png):
> The wheel is split into 2 layers of rollers each containing 10 rollers.
> Each roller is wrapped with heatshrink tubing and has a hole for an axle.
(See wheel/assembly.mp4 for assembly)
> A coupling piece is used to attach the wheel to the motor.
- Contains 3mm holes for grub screws to apply pressure on the shaft to prevent the wheel from slipping out.
- The wheel encases the coupling so the layers do not fall off the motor shaft.

Design is split into 3 sections:
> Layer 1 (Bottom layer)
  - holds ultrasonics
  - connects motor mounts from the bottom
> Layer 2 (Middle layer)
  - connects motor mounts from the top
  - goes under IR and has pillars connecting to L3
> Layer 3 (Top layer)
  - goes on top of IR
  - holds components that go on top such as breadboard, battery, switches
  - ball catcher hangs down from L3
  - goal stopper/handle at the back (stops the robot from going into its own goal)

Layer 1 (L1.png):
> Mounts ultrasonics and motor mounts
> Has indents on diagonals for motors

Layer 2 and motor mounts (L2_motor_mounts):
> Motor mounts encase the motor (the motors are attached via 2 screws at the front)
> Pillars on top of L2 go through holes in the IR to connect to L3.

Layer 3 (L3_holes.png):
> Wires (motor wires, ultrasonic wires) come from holes under the breadboard
> Battery is zip-tied using the holes to the left and right of its
> Breadboard is mounted to L3
