## Programming
We use C++ in [ArduinoIDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) to program our microcontroller (Teensy 4.1). (See code-2024/)
We also use Raspberry Pi Pico as part of our line sensor.

## 3D Printing
We design our parts in [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/au/products/fusion-360/education). (See mechanical design/)
All parts are printed in PLA.

## PCB Design
We design our PCBs in [KiCAD 7.0](https://www.kicad.org/) and order from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/). (See pcbs/).
The schematics are based on circuits we tested using breadboards.

All designs are original other than the [BBR IR Seeker](https://irseeker.buildingblockrobotics.com/)
